# The Impact of Air Quality on Respiratory Health

## Overview
This project, conducted in Fall 2023, delves into the critical issue of air pollution's effect on global health outcomes. Using comprehensive data analysis, it aims to understand the correlation between particulate matter pollution levels and mortality rates across various regions.

## Objectives
- Examine the link between air pollution and deaths across continents.
- Investigate the disparities in air pollution's impact globally.
- Assess the age-specific effects of air pollution over time.
- Explore the relationship between regional wealth and air quality.

## Methodology
The project utilizes data from credible sources like WHO, HealthData.org, and Our World in Data. The analysis includes examining particulate matter exposure, death rates due to air pollution, life expectancy trends, and chronic respiratory disease prevalence.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations are included:
1. Global Respiratory Infection Death Rates
2. Trends in Respiratory Deaths over Time
3. Comparative Age-Specific Mortality
4. Gender Disparity in Respiratory Infection Fatalities
5. Correlation between Air Pollution and Respiratory Deaths
6. Respiratory Infection Death Rates by Continent
7. Asthma Prevalence by WHO Region
8. Percentage COPD Prevalence in the USA

## Conclusions
Findings indicate a significant correlation between high pollution levels and increased mortality rates. The project highlights the need for targeted public health policies and underscores the complex interplay of factors affecting respiratory health.

## Future Research
Further investigation could explore the impact of air quality improvements on life expectancy and isolate the effects of air pollution on chronic diseases using longitudinal studies.
